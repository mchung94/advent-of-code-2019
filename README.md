# advent-of-code-2019
My Advent of Code 2019 solutions. I'm using LispWorks on Windows 10 for these
solutions. Later I'll check to make sure these work on SBCL.

For my first pass, I'll just try to get the right answers without trying to see
what other people have done. I'd like to go back again later and see the
better ideas and implementations by others.

To make it easy to work on one problem at a time, there's no system definition
or any dependencies (such as commonly used libraries or test frameworks). All
the tests are just part of each source code file and just use assert. This way,
people can just open the source code file for a given problem and not have to
worry about things defined elsewhere.
