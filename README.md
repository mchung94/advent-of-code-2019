# advent-of-code-2019
My Advent of Code 2019 solutions. I'm using LispWorks on Windows 10 for these
solutions. Later I'll check to make sure these work on SBCL.

There is no system defintion. Each source code file can be loaded and run on
its own. There is also no testing framework used here, tests are added into the
source code files and just use assert. To me, this makes it simple to work on
one problem at a time.
